# Lagos-Flood-Prediction
A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Floods In Lagos Nigeria

Flood Prediction Using  Gradient Boosting Model

This project predicts flood events using historical weather data from Lagos, Nigeria. The prediction is performed using  Gradient Boosting models. The aim is to predict the next date when a flood event will occur based on a series of input dates.

## Project Structure

- **Data**:
  - `lagos_weather_data_2002_to_2024.csv`: Historical weather data used for training the models.
  - `Lagos 2024-07-06 to 2024-12-31.csv`: Weather data used for making future predictions.

- **Code**:
  - `flood_prediction.py`: Main script containing data preprocessing, model training, and prediction functions.
  - `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
pip install tensorflow
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlip

```

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

-Handle missing values.

-Convert date columns to datetime format.

-Ensure numeric columns are in the correct format.

## Feature Engineering:

-Create additional features if necessary, such as rolling averages or lag features.

-Encode categorical variables if any.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Visualize the distribution of key variables.

-Explore correlations between features and the target variable (flooding events).

-Identify any seasonal patterns or trends.

## Model Building:

-Split the data into training and testing sets.

-Select appropriate models for time series prediction or classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

-Train and validate the models using cross-validation.

-Evaluate the models based on performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

## Model Evaluation and Selection:

-Compare the performance of different models.

-Choose the best model based on evaluation metrics.

-Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.

## Prediction:

-Use the trained model to predict future flooding events.

-Analyze the prediction results and their implications.

## Conclusion 
Conclude and deterimine a day based on the analysis carried out.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of SVM and Gradient Boosting models for predicting flood events based on historical weather data. The final implementation provides a function to predict the next flood event based on future weather data.
